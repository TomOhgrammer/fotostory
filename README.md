# Fotostory - Web Application

This project was inspired by a project I did as a birthday present for my niece.
She told me about this hype about interactive graphic novels and that she would like to make some for a friend as a birtday present. So I took care about it and  made a really rudimentary one with a little bit HTML and Javascript.

In this project I will turn the basic one in a more professional version.
